 * radios so THE FIRST BYTE MUST NOT BE either 0x00 or 0xFF. Also, for these radios
 * on End Devices the first byte should be the least significant byte so the filtering
 * is maximally effective. Otherwise the frame has to be processed by the MCU before it
 * is recognized as not intended for the device. APs and REs run in promiscuous mode so
 * the filtering is not done. This macro intializes a static const array of unsigned
 * characters of length NET_ADDR_SIZE (found in nwk_types.h). the quotes (") are
 * necessary below unless the spaces are removed.
